# task_scheduler
This is a toy level task scheduler for various micro controllers.

## goals
- simplicity comes first. the whole purpose of this project is to understand how RTOS 
  works so the code should be quite easy to follow. Performance is not the high priority here 
 
- modular so that it should be easy to add a new feature.
