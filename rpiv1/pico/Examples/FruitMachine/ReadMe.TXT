Fruit Machine version 9.10
--------------------------
The original version of this programme ran on 
a teletype terminal in 1972. By 1987 it was 
running in mode 15 on an Archimedes computer. 
It now operates in mode 27 or 28.

It was further developed for the Raspberry Pi 
'Pico'. Use CHAIN "FRUITMC9" to run me.

Click the flashing buttons to operate the 
fruit machine.

The feature table includes snakes and 
ladders with many squares that offer a win 
or a feature when you land on them.

Advance from square to square as the numbers 
appear on the win line. Matching fruits on 
the win line also gives a win. Wins and 
nudges can be gambled up or down using 
the table.
