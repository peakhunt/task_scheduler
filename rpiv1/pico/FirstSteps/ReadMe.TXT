Please note that the Second Edition of this book was prepared before the
launch of the Raspberry Pi and RISC OS 5. As a consequence, some of the
information relating to graphics is already out of date. In particular,
the graphics card supplied in the Raspberry Pi does not support the use of
16-colour screen modes.

A number of references are made to the RISC OS desktop, and the Window
Manager, neither of which are included on this cut down "Pico" edition.
To enjoy these aspects you probably should use the full "RISC OS Pi"
edition.

Several of the programs in this book make use of 16-colour screen modes:
these programs will run on a Raspberry Pi, but will switch to a 256-colour
mode instead, with the result that the colours shown on the screen will not
match those described in the book. Other graphical problems may also appear
in individual programs. Readers who work their way through the book may like
to try converting the programs to work well in 256 colours as an exercise to
test their newly-acquired skills.

The worst-affected of the programs is Munchie, which is the subject of
Chapter 11 and later sections. A special 256-colour version of this program,
Munchie_28, is therefore supplied for the benefit of Raspberry Pi users.
